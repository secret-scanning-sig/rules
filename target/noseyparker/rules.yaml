      Personal access tokens are an alternative to using passwords for
      authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line.

      Personal access tokens are intended to access GitHub resources on
      behalf of yourself. To access resources on behalf of an organization,
      or for long-lived integrations, you should use a GitHub App. For more
      information, see About creating GitHub Apps.

      A token has the same capabilities to access resources and perform
      actions on those resources that the owner of the token has, and is
      further limited by any scopes or permissions granted to the token. A
      token cannot grant additional access capabilities to a user. For
      example, a personal access token can be configured with an admin:org
      scope, but if the owner of the token is not an organization owner, the
      token will not give administrative access to the organization.
