# Secret Scanning Rules

A catalogue of known secret patterns

## Current Status

We recently completed a [generic pattern format research project](https://github.com/secret-scanning-sig/research/tree/research-generic-pattern-format/generic-pattern-format).
We're now in the process of setting consolidating patterns in this format.

## Repo Layout

Source rules are in the [rules directory](./rules) and are grouped by platform.

Rules translated to different supported providers are in the
[targets directory](./targets) so that you don't have to compile the rules
yourself.
